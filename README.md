# SSDLite_Mobilenet_v2
Working on TensorFlow Object Detection

Basically using theSSDLite_Mobilenet_v2 to predict classes, and Converting it to the ONNX format, to represent the Model.

This is a shorter version of using TFOD, as I am using an already available dataset, and I'm not using a personalised dataset, by using custom images, creating labels and using Transfer learning to predict a certain label
